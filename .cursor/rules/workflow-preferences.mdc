# Workflow Preferences

- focus on the areas of the code relevant to the task
- do no touch code that is unrelated to the task
- write thorough tests for all major functionality
- avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicity instructed
- always think about what other methods and areas code my be affected by code changes
