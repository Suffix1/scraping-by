# Next Steps for Uniqlo Price Tracker

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the Uniqlo Price Tracker application, organized as user stories for easier prioritization and development planning.

## 1. Scraper Robustness

### User Stories

#### 1.1 Enhanced Selector System
**As a** user tracking product prices,  
**I want** the app to reliably extract price information even when the website changes,  
**So that** I don't miss price drops due to technical issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement multiple selector strategies for each data point
- Create a fallback system that tries different selectors
- Log which selector succeeded for future optimization

#### 1.2 Error Resilience
**As a** user with many tracked products,  
**I want** the system to automatically retry failed scrapes,  
**So that** temporary errors don't result in missing price updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Add configurable retry count and delay settings
- Record success rate metrics to identify problematic URLs

#### 1.3 Anti-Detection Measures
**As a** user relying on the service,  
**I want** the scraper to avoid being blocked by Uniqlo's website,  
**So that** I can track prices continuously without interruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement user-agent rotation from a pool of common browsers
- Add random delays between requests to mimic human behavior
- Support proxy rotation for high-volume usage

## 2. Product Database Enhancements

### User Stories

#### 2.1 Product Variants Support
**As a** shopper interested in specific product variants,  
**I want** to track the same product in different colors and styles,  
**So that** I can be notified when my preferred variant goes on sale.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Allow tracking multiple color/style variants of a product
- Display variant information clearly in the UI
- Support filtering by variant attributes

#### 2.2 Price History Tracking
**As a** price-conscious shopper,  
**I want** to see the history of price changes for a product,  
**So that** I can identify patterns and make better purchasing decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Store historical price data with timestamps
- Calculate statistics like average price, highest, and lowest
- Show how long a product has been at its current price

#### 2.3 Price Trend Visualization
**As a** user considering a purchase,  
**I want** to visualize how a product's price has changed over time,  
**So that** I can predict if I should wait for a better deal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a simple graph showing price over time
- Highlight sales periods and regular prices
- Allow adjusting the time range (week, month, year)

## 3. User Experience Improvements

### User Stories

#### 3.1 Customizable Notifications
**As a** budget-conscious shopper,  
**I want** to set custom price thresholds for notifications,  
**So that** I'm only alerted when prices drop to my desired level.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Allow setting price thresholds per product
- Support percentage-based and absolute price drop notifications
- Provide options for notification frequency (immediate, daily, weekly)

#### 3.2 Product Collections
**As a** user tracking many products,  
**I want** to organize items into collections,  
**So that** I can manage my tracked items more effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create, edit, and delete collections
- Assign products to multiple collections
- View collection-wide statistics (total value, potential savings)

#### 3.3 Savings Dashboard
**As a** user tracking multiple items,  
**I want** a dashboard showing potential savings across all tracked products,  
**So that** I can prioritize purchases that offer the best value.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Show total potential savings across all tracked products
- Display items with the largest price drops
- Include metrics like "% off original price" for easy comparison

## 4. Technical Improvements

### User Stories

#### 4.1 Improved Test Coverage
**As a** developer maintaining the application,  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage for core functionality,  
**So that** I can make changes confidently without breaking existing features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Increase test coverage to at least 80% for core modules
- Add integration tests for the complete request-to-notification flow
- Implement visual regression tests for UI components

#### 4.2 Performance Optimization
**As a** user with many tracked products,  
**I want** the application to check prices efficiently,  
**So that** I receive timely updates without excessive resource usage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Optimize database queries for large product collections
- Implement batching and queuing for price checks
- Add caching for frequently accessed data

#### 4.3 API Documentation
**As a** developer integrating with the system,  
**I want** clear API documentation,  
**So that** I can build extensions or integrations easily.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Document all API endpoints with examples
- Create OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Include authentication and rate-limiting guidelines
